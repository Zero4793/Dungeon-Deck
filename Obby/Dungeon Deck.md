# [[Card Dictionary]]
The dictionary of all created cards. Currently no particular order.
# [[Lore]]
Perhaps as i progress this game idea, Lore will slowly generate via the cards and sets like it does in MTG and Hearthstone.

# Notes
decrease removal cards by increasing cost and/or rarity
2 hands = 2 special slots. hero powers/weapons/passives. played like HS weapons/staffs or MTG enchantments, and/or started with like HS hero powers. # start 0-2 being diff modes?
since this will more likely be single player. lean into the mode i prefer. the dungeon runs. where you build up decks over time and gain special passive abilities
quests, secrets/traps
enchantments/structures? non-minion persisting
have adventure chapters (dungeon runs) with story/lore
each unlock based on previous completions
first is the tutorial, led by Soldier Sam
adventures have chapters? each with a final boss, levels leading up forshadowing themes and mechanics of finale
