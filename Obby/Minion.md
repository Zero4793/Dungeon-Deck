# Subtypes *(Kin)*
*Also known as kin*
The species, race, breed, group, or collection of the Minion

*Kin* may often just be a label to identify and distinguish, but some *Kin* may also grant abilities.
* A spell may target only [[Human]].
* [[Undead]] take double damage from [[Holy]] spells.

*Kin* may also be children(subsets) of other *Kin*. In this case they include any abilities granted by their parent *Kin* and any effects that target the parent *Kin* also target their children.
* [[Basic Zombie]] and [[Basic Skeleton]] are both [[Undead]]
* Effects that specify [[Undead]] will effect both [[Basic Zombie]] and [[Basic Skeleton]]
* Effects that specify [[Basic Zombie]] will not effect all [[Undead]] such as [[Basic Skeleton]]
